🎵 Music Streaming App (Frontend + API)
ℹ️ Notes

Due to technical issues, only one track was uploaded to the Supabase storage bucket (Heavy- The marias).

The relatively few commits here are because the repo was pushed from a different directory. The original Git repo with full history is here: 👉 nunush146/music-stream.

This repository now uses TypeScript instead of JavaScript, improving type-safety and error debugging.

This repository contains a full-stack music streaming project, split into two main applications:

music-streaming-api/ — Backend (Next.js API routes, Prisma + Supabase)
👉 GOTO: Nahfer/music-streaming-API

music-streaming-frontend/ — Frontend (Next.js app, React)

The backend exposes REST API endpoints for artists, albums, playlists, authentication, and search.
The frontend consumes these APIs and provides a responsive UI with pages for discovery, artists, albums, playlists, profile, and authentication.

🗄️ Supabase (Database & Storage)

This project uses Supabase for:

Postgres Database (schema managed by Prisma)

Storage Buckets (for album art, artist images, audio files, user avatars)

Supabase assets are cached on a CDN to improve latency and reduce client-side processing.

Example Environment Variables
Backend (.env)
# Supabase Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@aws-1-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@aws-1-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"

# Auth
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"

Frontend (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://music-streaming-api-next.vercel.app

🛠️ Local Development
1. Prerequisites

Node.js v18+

npm / pnpm / yarn

A Supabase project with Postgres + storage bucket

2. Backend Setup
cd music-streaming-api
npm install

Create .env with DATABASE_URL, DIRECT_URL, and JWT_SECRET.

Run the development server:

npm run dev

Database setup:

npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push        # or: npx prisma migrate deploy

3. Frontend Setup
cd music-streaming-frontend
npm install


Create .env.local with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL.

Run the development server:

npm run dev


By default, both Next.js apps run on port 3000.
If running frontend and backend together, assign different ports (e.g., backend on 3001).

📌 API Endpoints
Endpoint	Method	Description
/api/auth/register	POST	Register a new user
/api/auth/login	POST	Login & receive JWT

🚀 Deployment

Both frontend and backend are deployed on Vercel.
Next.js provides first-class support for Vercel deployments.

🔮 Next Steps

Verify Prisma schema matches your Supabase schema.

Configure RLS policies and bucket permissions in Supabase before production.

Consider using Supabase’s JS client for signed URL generation and media uploads.
